Matching algorithm, by default, sorts query parameters by ampersand to do
the classification, but values for 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'x' are unpredictable
for us, so we need to ignore the query parameters part on classification:

{
  "algorithm":"FullMatching",
  "uriPathQueryParametersFilter":"Ignore"
}

In this way, our request 'uri' is constant within the provision definition.
Regarding the function calculation, we will use variables substitution to
build the math expression, getting the function coeficients (a, b, c) and
variable (x) from query parameters received.
Finally, the target as integer type implies truncating the float result
for the function value.
