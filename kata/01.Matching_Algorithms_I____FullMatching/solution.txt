Matching algorithm, by default, sorts query parameters, then
 "/one/uri/path?name=Hayek&city=Friburgo" turns into
 "/one/uri/path?city=Friburgo&name=Hayek" which is not exactly provisioned.

You need to specify 'PassBy' for 'uriPathQueryParametersFilter' to respect the
 original URI received:

{
  "algorithm": "FullMatching",
  "uriPathQueryParameters": {
    "filter": "PassBy"
  }
}

Another solution would be provision the ordered version of the *URL*, but this
 exercise didn't allow to update that configuration.
