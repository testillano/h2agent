Just transfer a foreign state assignment within DELETE provision:

{
  "source": "value.get-obtains-not-found",
  "target": "outState.GET"
}

And then, add the new provision with that value 'get-obtains-not-found' as
 inState and 404 as response status code.

It is also interesting to force the DELETE provision to go into a 'road-closed'
 state in order to get stuck on 204 status code, so subsequent DELETE requests
 will return always that 204 status code as 'already deleted' (no content).

LIMITATIONS:

If you POST again, you cannot GET the data. So, the simulation is not
 completely perfect.
POST request URI is normally different than GET and DELETE ones, so we could
 add the URI to the foreign state to make a more realistic example.
