Just transfer a foreign state assignment within DELETE provision:

{
  "source": "value.get-obtains-not-found",
  "target": "outState.GET"
}

And then, add the new provision with that value 'get-obtains-not-found' as
 inState and 404 as response status code.

It is also interesting to force the DELETE provision to go into a 'road-closed'
 state in order to get stuck on 204 status code, so subsequent DELETE requests
 will return always that 204 status code as 'already deleted' (no content).

LIMITATIONS:

If you POST again, you cannot GET the data. So, the simulation is not
 completely perfect.
It should be necessary to have a mechanism to specify a different URI than
 current when changing the foreign state.
This is because the POST request URI is different than GET and DELETE ones.
In this way, we could initialize the provisions for DELETE and GET.
