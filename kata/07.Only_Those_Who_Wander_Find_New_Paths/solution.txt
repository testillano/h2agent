We need firstly to mirror the source 'request.body' into the target 'response.body.object'.
Then, we need to store the numbers received, just transfering them into three variables
using a non-filter transformation like this:

    {
      "source": "request.body.number1",
      "target": "var.number1"
    }

Then, we build a constant expression with source 'value' by mean parsing the former variables
and targeting the path 'processed.numbers' as a json string literal:

    {
      "source": "value.[ @{number1}, @{number2}, @{number3} ]",
      "target": "response.body.jsonstring.processed.numbers"
    }

And finally, we transfer the header 'app-version' into the response json path required:

    {
      "source": "request.header.app-version",
      "target": "response.body.string.processed.appVersion"
    }
