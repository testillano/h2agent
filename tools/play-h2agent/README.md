# H2Agent Play

## Prepare the environment

Check [README.md](../../README.md#Prepare-the-environment).

## Start to play

Once `h2agent` process is [started](#Prepare-the-environment), run the script (use another terminal if needed):

```bash
$ tools/play-h2agent/run.sh
```

Although this is a moderate set of examples, it will be expanded in the future as new exercises are considered useful to improve understanding of the process. The idea is to present use cases that are as practical and common as possible to avoid overwhelming the reader with information given the immense flexibility of the system and its possibilities.
